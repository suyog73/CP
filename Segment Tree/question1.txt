You are given two arrays A1 and A2 of length n1 and n2 respectively. Also you are given q queries. Each query is of 2 types:
take type as a input
type 1: take a input l, r 
	print the min(min(A1(l,r), min(A2(l,r))))
type 2: take a input arrayNo, index, val
	update the index of an given arrayNo with value val.
	
input:
n1=8, n2=6
A1= {1, 6, 4, 7, 9, 2, 1, 6}
A2= {5, 6, 9, 7, 3, 0}

q=3
1 1 4 3 6
